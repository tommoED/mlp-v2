Okay.So key features of our method, we wanted to see if we could teach reasoning about date times to a very small language model. The results are promising. The method is to generate a dataset because it wasn't a dataset available that used that with With the kind of data that we wanted to use Obviously the Gregorian calendar is a very non kind of arithmetic space So we used a syntax to represent certain kinds of relative time expressions based off of Python's relative delta package. Which improved the performance of the model's reasoning which had likely been prior exposed to Python and possibly even the relative delta syntax.
